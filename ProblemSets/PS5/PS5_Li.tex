\section{Introduction}
The data I chose is the top 250 movies of all time according to IMBD. One thing I love doing is watching TV and Movies. I originally tried this with at least 8 different websites before I realized I was using the singular form of node. So it kept on giving me back only one result. 

For my API I scrapped Reddit news. I am going to admit I spend way too much time on that website looking at funny cat photos. I've always wondered how much other users like cats too. So I used an R package called "ExtractR" to gather information on reddit comments on cats. It was really fun. This may become useful down the line if I ever want to gather data from reddit for a project!
